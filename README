# What is it?
implement plain user-land protocol stack in Rust.

# Why protocol stack?
thread programming and mutex control is needed to do this project,
which is important in system engineering.

# Prerequisite?
- Ubuntu 20.04(Will test in Ubuntu 22.04)

# Reference to do this project?
- [lwIP](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/)
- [microps](https://github.com/pandax381/microps)(especially for tap engineering)

# Roadmap?
- network interface and protocol stack initialisation(only UDP and TCP?).
- tap devide driver engineering.
- set up data structures and functions to utilise this protocol stack.
- implement simple tcp server program and tcp client program.
