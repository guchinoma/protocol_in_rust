# What is it
implement plain protocol stack in Rust

# Why protocol stack
thread programming and mutex control is needed to do this project,
which is important in system engineering

# Reference to do this project
- [lwIP](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/)
- [microps](https://github.com/pandax381/microps)(especially for tap engineering)

# Roadmap?
- network interface and protocol stack initialisation
- tap devide driver engineering
- tcp protocol stack
